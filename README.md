# HiveBox API
A RESTful API to track environmental sensor data for beekeepers using openSenseMap data.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a scalable RESTful API around [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) but customized to help beekeeper with their chores. The API output should be in JSON. You will start with a basic implementation, then extend the whole system to handles thousands of requests per second.
